#But What Does It Do... Iterables
This is a talk for DenverScript. Includes slides and some example code.

To run examples:

```bash
$ DEBUG=bwdid:* node examples/index.js
```

The examples are busted out into different little functions, so you can run
them individually or all at once... just uncomment the one you are interested
in.
